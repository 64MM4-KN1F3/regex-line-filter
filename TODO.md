[ ] Text selection behaviour in filtered mode also selects all the filtered-out text in between the filtered text. Eg. If I toggle the filter selecting for all lines that contain a thumbs-up emoji, if I select all the lines of this filered text then make them bold, when I toggle the filter off I see that all the unfiltered text in between the filtered lines with thumbs-up emojis is also made bold.
